# BayesianCellCounts
This repository contains code for fitting Bayesian Hierarchical Models to structured cell count data - for example from neuroscience experiments measuring labeled cell counts across multiple brain regions, individuals, groups, etc.

The general method is described in:
Dimmock SJ, Exley BMS, Moore G, Menage L, Delogu A, Schultz SR, Warburton EC, Houghton C, Oâ€™Donnell C (2024) Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of multi-region brain cell count data eLife 13:RP102391
https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.102391.1

The code used in that paper is originally hosted here: https://github.com/SydneyJake/Hierarchical_Bayesian_Cell_Counts. The code is also copied within this repo for posterity.
